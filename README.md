### zkRSA

This repository's goal will be to perform verifications of rsa signatures within a circom circuit.

The `circom-rsa-verify` folder contains all necessary circuits and tests for carrying out such signature verifications.

The `zkrsa-ui` contains the UI for generating or verifying proofs of valid RSA signatures using circom.
